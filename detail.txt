Model Description: Gradient Boosting Regression for Car Purchase Amount Prediction

Objective:
  > The goal of this model is to predict the Car Purchase Amount based on customer features such as 
    Gender, Age, Annual Salary, Credit Card Debt, and Net Worth.

Model Used:
  > We used Gradient Boosting Regressor, an ensemble learning technique that builds multiple decision trees sequentially,
    where each new tree corrects the errors of the previous trees. This allows the model to capture complex relationships 
    and improve prediction accuracy.

Data Preprocessing:
    > Categorical Encoding: Gender was converted into numerical form using Label Encoding.
    > Feature Scaling: Numeric features were standardized to ensure all features contribute equally to the model.
    > Train-Test Split: Data was split into training and test sets to evaluate performance on unseen data.

Model Training & Evaluation:
    > The model was trained on the processed training data and evaluated on the test set.

Performance Metrics:
    > RÂ² Score: 0.96 (indicating the model explains 96% of the variance in the target variable)
      Mean Squared Error (MSE): 3,375,057.82

Feature importance analysis showed which customer attributes had the most influence on car purchase amounts.

Conclusion:
    > The Gradient Boosting Regressor performed exceptionally well for this dataset, making it a reliable choice 
      for predicting car purchase amounts. It can also be used for future predictions on new customer data.
